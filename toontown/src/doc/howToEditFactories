HOW TO EDIT FACTORIES

1. SETUP
========
You must be able to run DIRECT to edit factories.

Check $DIRECT/src/level/EditorGlobals.py to see if you have an edit
username. If not, add your username to the table (and make sure you assign
yourself an unused EntIdRange).

Once you have an edit username, you must config:

level-edit-username <your username>

You will need magic words, and you need to be running in the dev
environment (want-dev 1, normally on by default in
$TOONTOWN/src/configfiles/Configrc).

2. EDITING
==========
Start Toontown, enter a factory, and type ~fedit. After a brief delay, the
factory editor should pop up.

The left pane of the editor shows the heirarchy of entities that exist in
the level. To edit the properties of an entity, first select the entity by
clicking on it in the left pane. (Any entities that have representations in
the 3D game world can also be selected by left-clicking on them in the
graphics window.) Once an entity is selected, its 'attributes' are
displayed in the right pane of the editor. By editing these attributes, you
change the selected entity.

To add a new entity, first select a parent entity in the left pane; the new
entity will appear under the parent entity in the heirarchy. Then open the
Entity menu and select the desired entity type.

To save your changes, select File->Save on AI.
