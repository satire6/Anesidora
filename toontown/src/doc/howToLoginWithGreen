
Open server web page to DB
run SQL query to list all accounts
find toon you want to login as by searching for his name
get his OwningAccount hex number (like 0xFEE1F505)
convert that hex to dec (little endian)
  On windows, use calc but type in hex pairs backwards, 
   so 0xFEE1F505 becomes 05 F5 E1 FE (without the spaces)
Convert to decimal to get a number like 100000254

Look for that decimal number under primary_int
Get the swid from the primary_str field under that primary_int 
  it will look something like {A6A07F9F-4BD9-4ADB-4BD9-4ADB}

Dconfig auto-login with that swid

auto-login {A6A07F9F-4BD9-4ADB-4BD9-4ADB}

Now run the game - you should see that account's avatars!
